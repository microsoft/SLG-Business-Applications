# Dynamics 365 and Power Platform Copilot Feature Availability in GCC
> [!IMPORTANT]
> November 7, 2024 through Nov 12, 2024 we are going live with Phase 2 of Copilot availbility for Power Platform and Dynamics 365 in GCC and GCC High!  For more information on what this means, [go here](https://github.com/microsoft/Federal-Business-Applications/blob/main/whitepapers/copilot/README.md).

The goal of this whitepaper is to serve as a guide for all US state and local government customers to understand the availability of various Power Platform Copilot features in GCC.  We also want to outline our Microsoft Responsible AI framework.  

This document will continue to evolve as we roll out more features and functionality over time.

## Responsible AI
Every Microsoft Business Applications service has their own dedicated Responsible AI page on our public documentation site.  Below we have summarized the links for all Power Platform and Dynamics 365 services and their associated Responsible AI page.

## Azure OpenAI
Azure OpenAI is the service that all Copilot features are built upon. 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Your prompts (inputs) and completions (outputs), your embeddings, and your training data:
> 
> * are NOT available to other customers.
> * are NOT available to OpenAI.
> * are NOT used to improve OpenAI models.
> * are NOT used to improve any Microsoft or 3rd party products or services.
> * are NOT used for automatically improving Azure OpenAI models for your use in your resource (The models are stateless, unless you explicitly fine-tune models with your training data).
> 
> Your fine-tuned Azure OpenAI models are available exclusively for your use.
The Azure OpenAI Service is fully controlled by Microsoft; Microsoft hosts the OpenAI models in Microsoftâ€™s Azure environment and the Service does NOT interact with any services operated by OpenAI (e.g. ChatGPT, or the OpenAI API).

For a full description of Azure OpenAI's data, privacy and security details, you can find them in the link below,

## Dynamics 365 and Power Platform Copilots
The sections and tables that follow identify all known Copilot features in Dynamics 365 Customer Service and Power Platform.  The tables show to availability of each feature in both commercial cloud and in GCC.
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> There's now a central Microsoft documentation page that outlines all Dynamics 365 and Power Platform Generative AI features and the controls you have for each of them.  That document can be found in the link below,

* The Dates shown are when each feature's availability was last evaluated.
* GA = Generally Available
* "Early Access" is a phase that may come prior to "Preview".

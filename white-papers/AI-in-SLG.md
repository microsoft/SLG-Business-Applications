# AI in State & Local Government
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize state and local government (SLG) operations, driving efficiency, improving citizen services, and enhancing decision-making processes. AI can automate routine tasks, freeing up valuable time for government employees to focus on more strategic initiatives. It can analyze vast amounts of data to provide actionable insights, enabling better planning and resource allocation. Moreover, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can offer citizens quicker responses to their queries, improving overall satisfaction.

**The Microsoft Business Applications Portfolio, consisting of Dynamics 365 and the Power Platform, offers the ideal platform for State & Local Government entities looking to apply the power of AI to their business operations**. Dynamics 365 provides comprehensive, intelligent applications that connect data across various government functions, enabling streamlined operations and better citizen engagement. The Power Platform empowers SLG entities to build custom applications, automate workflows, and analyze data with minimal coding, making AI accessible and actionable for everyone in the organization.

Below you'll find our ideas for how AI can be applied in various verticals of State & Local Government.

## Health and Human Services, Child Welfare: C.H.A.S.E.

## Public Safety and Justice: I.R.I.S.
Law enforcement agencies face numerous challenges in conducting thorough and efficient investigations. The sheer volume of evidence, including hours of body cam footage and emergency call recordings, can overwhelm investigators, making it difficult to extract critical information promptly. Analyzing witness testimonies for inconsistencies and corroborating details demands meticulous attention, and creating composite sketches of suspects based on witness descriptions is both time-consuming and challenging. Moreover, accurately logging and managing all investigative findings and case notes is essential to ensure comprehensive and effective case management.

Introducing IRIS - the Intelligent, Resourceful Investigation Support bot, designed to revolutionize the investigative process. Embedded within an investigations case management system, IRIS leverages next-generation generative AI models to assist public investigators in various ways. From providing aerial imagery of case points of interest to analyzing hours of case evidence and drawing composite sketches of suspects, IRIS enhances the efficiency and accuracy of investigations. By automating these complex tasks, IRIS allows investigators to focus on the critical aspects of their work, ensuring that justice is served swiftly and effectively.

## Fleet Management and Inspections: E.V.V.I.E.
Fleet management in state and local government (SLG) entities is a critical yet demanding responsibility. From law enforcement to public works, maintaining large fleets of vehicles requires meticulous attention to detail, regular maintenance, and routine inspections. These inspections, while essential for ensuring vehicle safety and operational efficiency, can be time-consuming and cumbersome for staff. Manual inspections often lead to inconsistencies and human error, making it challenging to accurately assess and log vehicle conditions.

Introducing the Enterprise Visual Vehicle Inspection Engine (E.V.V.I.E.), the innovative solution designed to simplify and streamline the inspection process. With EVVIE, staff can easily take photos of vehicles using their smartphones. The system automatically assesses and logs any damage, providing consistent and accurate inspection reports. This not only saves time but also enhances the reliability of fleet management, ensuring that all vehicles are in optimal condition and ready for service. EVVIE revolutionizes the way SLG entities manage their fleets, driving efficiency and reducing operational burdens.

## Overview
The **PowerGPT Solution** is a low-code conversational interface built entirely with **Power Apps** and **AI Builder**, offering an experience similar to Microsoft Copilot or ChatGPT — without requiring any external APIs, HTTP calls, or keys.

This solution leverages the **AI Builder Prompt** model to generate intelligent responses based on user input. It also maintains **conversation context**, enabling users to ask follow-up questions and continue natural dialogues across multiple turns. Additionally, chat history is **saved to Dataverse**, allowing users to revisit and continue previous conversations.

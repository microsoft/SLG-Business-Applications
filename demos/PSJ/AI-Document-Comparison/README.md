**AI Document Comparison Use Case "Priors Research Team"**
----------------------------

**The use case was built initially for a District Attorney's office looking to improve the efficiency of the Priors Research Team.  The business problem is below:**

District Attorney personnel are required to review and understand large amounts of documented information pertaining to a case.  One of these groups is referred to at the “Priors Research” team.  This team tasked with reviewing CLETS and DOJ reports (among potentially other documents) associated with defendants who are part of a case.  They are asked to ensure that the DA’s office has a full and complete history around any defendant that may be prosecuted.  At this time, much of the review and comparison of prior history is done manually.  CLETS & DOJ reports are downloaded or printed and then compared side-by-side for commonalities or discrepancies.  This requires a significant amount of manual work and leaves open the doors to missing key pieces of information as part of that research process.

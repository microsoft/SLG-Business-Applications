# State & Local Government Case Management Build Series
Want to build an enterprise solution with us?  

Our January 2025 Tech Series features a 3-part solution build series leveraging Dynamics 365 and Power Apps. The use case will be an Equal Opportunity Case Management system built on Dynamics 365 Case Management, Dataverse, Power Pages and an inspections app for a front-line worker. Overall objective of this session is to teach the end-to-end process for designing and developing an enterprise solution with multiple user experiences on Microsoft Business Applications. The foundational assets will be available on our GitHub Repo to download and follow along or build your own case management system regardless of the department or agency nuances.

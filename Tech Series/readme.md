# SLG Business Applications Tech Evangelism Series
The Microsoft SLG Business Applications team presents a series of monthly sessions to educate, inform, and inspire State & Local government organizations to achieve more with Power Platform!

We deliver valuable insights and expertise across three pillars, each month, to cater to diverse needs and skill levels:
- **AI Business Solutions** - The AI Business Solutions pillar strives to spotlight transformative, real-world solutions that harness the power of Microsoft’s Business Applications as a unifying platform. By integrating with Modern Work, Azure Data & AI, and virtually any ecosystem—Microsoft or otherwise—this pillar demonstrates how organizations can break down silos and create holistic, intelligent workflows. Through compelling customer stories and practical examples, our mission is to inspire innovation, accelerate adoption, and showcase the full potential of AI-driven business transformation.​
- **Copilot Agents** - This series will explore how Copilot Agents—powered by Copilot Studio and Microsoft 365 Copilot—are transforming the way organizations automate, personalize, and scale business processes, with real-world scenarios showing how low-code AI agents can be used within the Power Platform and rapidly built, deployed, and integrated across agency and department needs; attendees will gain insights into designing intelligent copilots that enhance productivity, streamline operations, and deliver measurable business value.
- **Advanced Power Platform** - The Advanced Power Platform Capabilities pillar showcases how makers and pro developers can collaboratively build scalable, enterprise-ready solutions by extending the platform with TypeScript, C#, and Python, integrating with Azure and GitHub to enable sophisticated apps and automations, and driving innovation through advanced development patterns and practical, real-world demonstrations.

By attending these monthly sessions, you'll gain a deeper understanding of Power Platform and its applications in State & Local government, as well as valuable insights from Microsoft experts and peers. Join us to stay ahead of the curve and achieve more with Power Platform!
